This script is meant as an example for rotation students, new students, or other lab members interested in learning more about using pytorch lightning to train neural networks to predict the funciton of proteins given a sequence. 

Example for training a neural network to predict functional scores from sequence inputs.

This specific example takes protein sequences as input and predicts a single funcitonal score. The training data is for the model protein Gb1 and contains all single mutations and most double mutations of the 56 residue protein. 

There are notes interspersed throughout Seq2FxnNN_example.ipynb explaining what each section does.
